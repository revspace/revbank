=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RevBank::Global;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module unconditionally exports the following symbols into the calling
namespace:

=head2 ACCEPT, ABORT, REJECT, NEXT

Return codes for plugins. See L<RevBank::Plugins>.

=head2 say

Print with newline, in case your Perl version doesn't already have a C<say>.

=head2 call_hooks($hook, @arguments)

See C<call_hooks> in L<RevBank::Plugins>.

=head2 parse_amount($amount)

Returns the amount given if it is well formed, undef if it was not. Dies if
the given amount exceeds certain boundaries.

Commas are changed to periods so C<3,50> and C<3.50> both result in C<3.5>.

=head2 parse_user($username)

Returns the canonical username, or undef if the account does not exist.

See C<parse_user> in L<RevBank::Accounts> for the gory details.
