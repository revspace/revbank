=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script translates a RevBank log file to Beancount 2 format, which can then
be used with beancount tools such as the web interface Fava:

	perl contrib/revbank-log2beancount.pl > revbank.beancount
	fava revbank.beancount

Call this script from the directory that contains C<revbank.accounts> and
C<.revbank.log>. Optionally, a different log file can be given on the command
line, to be used instead of C<.revbank.log>.

=head2 Caveats

This results in an incomplete administration, as RevBank will undoubtedly be
unaware of most expenses, and income through contribution fees. So while the
total numbers (like "net profit") are mostly useless, the numbers for
individual accounts may be insightful, and it provides pretty charts.

RevBank uses datetime with a 1 second resolution, but Beancount 2 only supports
date granularity, so it can't give intradate numbers. The time is recorded as
metadata but otherwise ignored by Beancount; they postings are in the right
order because it's a stable sort, not because the time is taken into account.

Note that compared to a typical Beancount ledger, all amounts will be flipped,
i.e. -42 becomes +42 and +42 becomes -42. This is because RevBank's bookkeeping
is done from the users' perspectives, rather than that of the organization.
Incidentally, the resulting numbers will also make more intuitive sense as
income is now positive and expenses are negative - which is not what a typical
Beancount administration would look like, but would seem more logical to most
lay persons.

Beancount transaction descriptions are attached to the booking, not to its
individual postings, while RevBank has a different description for each
account, again because it works from the perspectives of the users. The
descriptions are converted as string metadata. To view them in Fava, enable
both Metadata and Postings.

Fava beans can be deadly for persons with G6PD deficiency, because the beans
contain vicine, which is toxic to them as vicine oxidises glutathione faster
than these people can regenerate it. The resulting hemolytic anemia due to
premature breakdown of red blood cells can culminate in a fatal hemolytic
crisis. G6PD deficiency is a hereditary enzyme deficiency that is estimated to
affect 5% of Earth's human population.
